<h3 align="center">Hi, I’m Ravi — Embedded Systems Engineer & Rust/Linux Enthusiast</h3>

## 🚀 Who I Am

I’m an engineer who enjoys building **low-level, high-reliability systems** where software meets hardware.  
My work focuses on:

- Embedded Linux (Yocto, U-Boot, Device Tree)
- ARM-based platforms (Zynq MPSoC / i.MX / Raspberry Pi)
- Rust and C/C++ for real-time, systems-level software
- Microcontrollers with FreeRTOS or baremetal
- State machines, protocol design, and deterministic pipelines

I like solving problems close to the metal — where timing, memory, architecture, and correctness truly matter.

## 🌑 Why *Blackbox Astron*?

Because I treat every system like a **spacecraft blackbox**:

- Minimal  
- Predictable  
- Instrumented  
- Resilient  
- Debuggable down to the wire  

And **“Astron”** reflects my deep interest in space systems, mission design, and high-reliability engineering.

## 🛰 What I’ve Worked On

- Designing software architecture for **real-time embedded systems**
- Building communication layers and protocol handlers
- Developing device-level modules and hardware–software control logic
- Working with DMA pipelines, buffers, and performance-critical data paths
- Creating tooling and workflows to improve developer efficiency
- Delivering embedded systems used in real environments  
- Prototyping across various platforms (MPSoC, Raspberry Pi, i.MX) from scratch
- Participating in recruiting hardware and FPGA engineers
- Exploring collaborations in the digital/embedded world
- Continuously challenging myself with new technical problems

Previously, I have worked across:

- **Medical devices**  
- **IoT systems**  
- **Embedded R&D projects**  
- **Linux platform bring-up**  
- **Firmware and driver-level development**  

I enjoy building systems that require reliability, clarity, and strong architectural foundations.
